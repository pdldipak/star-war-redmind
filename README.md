******This project is done by using javascript library: react and css framework: bootstrap, and axios library is used to fecth data from API. ******



What parts did you struggle with and why?
****The project is not so hard to complete, but I got a bit confusing, with API, I didn't find clear documentation of filtering its values. Thus, making a function to make filter either by first or last name makes me a bit confused****



Would you do anything differently if you were to do it again?
***** I have used only class-based components and used props to pass data from parents to child components and used call back function to pass data from child to parents. If I do this project again, I will probably use functional components so that I can use hooks and redux for state management, so it will become easy to pass data to any component. Further, I will use if else statemenet while searching by name. At now I just tried to make it simple  *****
